Hey thanks again for reaching out, you may go ahead and share one of my reels if you’re still interested, please do regard the following requirements:

If you’re going to share my video as a story, please ensure my username “~user” is layered on top of the video as black text with a white background that links to my profile, further please ensure this text appears as a large size across devices (at least 2/3 the width of common mobile devices). 

If you’re going to share my video as a reel post, please ensure the caption text has “~user” at the beginning and end of the post. 

I should receive a notification in either case, I’m looking forward to it, thanks for your interest!
